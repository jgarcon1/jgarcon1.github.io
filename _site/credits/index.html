<p><a href="http://onamove.com"><strong>MOVE Organization</strong></a>, a Black revolutionary organization founded in 1972, is perhaps Philadelphia’s most well-known Black political organization, due to two events: the political imprisonment of the MOVE 9 in 1978, whose surviving members have been recently released after 40 years, and the tragic bombing of the MOVE organization home in West Philadelphia in 1985 by the Philadelphia police, during which 11 adults and children were killed and two city blocks were burnt down. RBP is collaborating with Mike Africa Jr. to digitize a portion of his personal collection of MOVE organization materials, which includes hundreds of privately-held organizational materials including documents recovered from the site of 1985 bombing, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, legal documents, letters to incarcerated members, protest signs, and other organizational materials.</p>

<p><a href="https://wphsaa.org"><strong>West Philadelphia High School Association</strong></a>, is a highly organized network that works to preserve the legacy of West Philadelphia High School, one of Philadelphia’s oldest public high schools, after the controversial closure of its historic location in 2011 and its relocation to a new site after being sold to developers to be converted into luxury apartments without community support. RBP is working to digitize over 100 years of school yearbooks and host two West Philadelphia high-school focused digitization events to collect community-held materials related to the school from alumni and community members.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.philasd.org/pstv/"><strong>School District of Philadelphia (PSTV)</strong></a>,
For the past two years, RBP has been working with Philadelphia-based youth media-maker to document the changes they’ve experienced in their own neighborhoods in micro-documentary form. The project is in collaboration with PSTV, the education channel for The School District of Philadelphia (SDP), and is open to ALL enrolled students who have a current school-issued ID, including public, charter, private and parochial schools. PSTV broadcasts youth-driven programming created by and for students that benefit them and their communities, 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>PSTV leads the charge with democratizing access to industry-standard multidimensional media arts training platforms that support all forms of learning from individualized, school-based, community-based, and traditional.</p>
